        "- Detects primary intent (dental-implant domain signals).\n",

        "- Scores business alignment (value props, personas, differentiators, pain-point solutions).\n",

        "MUVERA is a semantic analysis framework designed to evaluate how well a piece of content aligns with both user intent and business messaging.\n",
        "\n",
        "It combines NLP techniques—TF-IDF, SVD dimensionality reduction, and similarity modeling—to generate a single MUVERA Score (0–1) that reflects:\n",
        "\n",
        "- How clearly the content matches specific user intents (e.g., cost, eligibility, recovery).\n",
        "\n",
        "- How strongly it reinforces brand and business themes (value propositions, audience needs, differentiators).\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal: to make content optimization measurable—so teams can identify which pages communicate intent effectively and which need refinement."
